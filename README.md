## 💾 Data Model

### Core Entities

```python
Course              # Educational course container
├── Lesson          # Individual content units
├── Question        # Assessment items with point values
│   └── Choice      # Answer options with correctness flags
└── Enrollment      # User-course relationship
    └── Submission  # Exam attempts with selected answers
````

---

### Key Design Decisions

#### Denormalization for Performance

* `Course.total_enrollment`: Cached count of enrolled students
* `Course.average_rating`: Pre-calculated from enrollment ratings
* Eliminates expensive `COUNT(*)` and `AVG()` queries on large datasets

#### Database Indexing Strategy

```python
indexes = [
    models.Index(fields=['pub_date']),        # Course publication queries
    models.Index(fields=['course', 'order']), # Lesson ordering
    models.Index(fields=['user', 'course']),  # Enrollment lookups
]
```

#### Strict Grading Algorithm

* Questions can have multiple correct answers
* Full points awarded only when **ALL** correct choices are selected
* No partial credit (configurable for future enhancement)

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* Django 3.2+
* Virtual environment (recommended)

---

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd onlinecourse-platform

# Create and activate virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run migrations
python manage.py migrate

# Create superuser
python manage.py createsuperuser

# Load sample data (optional)
python manage.py loaddata sample_courses.json

# Start development server
python manage.py runserver
```

---

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
DEBUG=True
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///db.sqlite3
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python manage.py test

# Run specific test modules
python manage.py test onlinecourse.tests.test_models

python manage.py test onlinecourse.tests.test_admin

# Run with coverage report
coverage run --source='.' manage.py test
coverage report
```

## 📊 Performance Optimizations

1. **Query Optimization**

   * `select_related()` for ForeignKey relationships
   * `prefetch_related()` for ManyToMany and reverse relations
   * Custom queryset methods for common lookups

2. **Caching Strategy**

   * Denormalized counters for enrollment statistics
   * Template fragment caching for course listings
   * Database indexes on frequently filtered fields

3. **Pagination**

   * Admin list views: 50 items per page
   * Course listings: 12 items per page
   * API endpoints: Configurable page sizes

---

## 🔒 Security Features

* **CSRF Protection**: Enabled on all forms
* **XSS Prevention**: Django template auto-escaping
* **SQL Injection Protection**: Parameterized queries via ORM
* **Authentication**: Django's built-in auth system
* **Authorization**: Role-based permission checks
* **HTTPS Enforcement**: Configurable in production

---

## 📈 Monitoring & Analytics

Built-in metrics for:

* Course popularity (enrollment counts)
* Question difficulty (success rate per question)
* Student performance (score distributions)
* Instructor effectiveness (average ratings)
